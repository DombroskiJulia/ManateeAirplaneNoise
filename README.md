# ManateeAirplaneNoise
This repository contains example scripts and datasets used to investigate exposure and behavioral responses of manatees on Florida's Atlantic Coast to airplane noise.

## Description of the Data and file structure
Files include acceleration and pressure data downsampled to 5Hz for all animals in the study, along with metadata stored in netCDF files (tm17_010aAP5.nc; tm17_011aAP5.nc and tm19_072aAP5.nc); R datasets with GPS data for all 3 animals (tm17_010a_move.RData; tm17_011a_move.RData; tm19_072a_move.Rdata);examples of airplane noise detected on the audio of DTAGs (airplane1.wav; airplane2.wav); timing of airplane exposures detected on the audio of tm17_010a (tm17_010a_airplane_samples) and script with an example of how the dataset was processed to investigate diving and flight responses of manatees to airplane noise exposure (before_during_analysis).   


## Code/Software

We used MATLAB 2015, 2022 and R version 4.2.1 to run the analysis described in our study
